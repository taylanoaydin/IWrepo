This repository contains modifications of the Ant Maze environment found in https://github.com/MichalBortkiewicz/JaxGCRL for the purposes of my independent work project at Princeton. Can be inserted into the envs/ folder in the original codebase along with minor modifications to the utils.py file to test these environments using the training scripts in the codebase (a file called ant_maze2.xml would also have to be added to envs/assets/, but it can be a duplicated of ant_maze.xml already found there).
